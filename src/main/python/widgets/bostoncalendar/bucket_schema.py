'''A BucketSchema maintains a collection of names associated with tests, and
sorts items into buckets by which bucket is the first to return a truthy
value.
  There are two orders a BucketSchema maintains: a name order and a test
order. 
  The test order determines the order in which the buckets are tested 
against the item. This is determined by the order in which buckets are added.
  The name order determines the order of the returned OrderedDict of buckets.
This is determined by the name_order parameter, which also functions as the ID.'''
