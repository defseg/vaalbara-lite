# vaalbara-lite
An RSS feed reader that lives in the taskbar and can be packaged with fbs. Requires Python 3.6 because fbs does. Based on [Vaalbara](https://github.com/defseg/vaalbara), but the innards have been rewritten to take out all the non-RSS stuff. (Mostly as an exercise in working with old code.)
